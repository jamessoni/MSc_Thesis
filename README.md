This repository contains the report, code and documentation which sees the development and implementation of predictive PredGAN and DA-PredGAN models. 

The project entails predictive modelling with use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in a novel approach of Enhanced Training; seeing the direct implementation of pre-defined sensor locations in making spatio-temporal predictions of viral laden air fluid flow.

The system is written in the programming language, Python, maximising the advantages of Machine Learning libraries, use of Google Colab's GPU's, and for graphical post-processing.
